Snowflake is an analytical cloud data warehouse, itâ€™s designed primarily for analytical workloads (OLAP)

1. SaaS(Software as a Service) based Datawarehouse
2. Pay per use - Cloud be monthly,annual or usage based on subscription
3. MPP(Massive parallel processing) - data will be distributed evenly in all nodes
4. when user fires a query all nodes will work in parallel

**Architecture**
It is multi-cluster shared data architecture,  Snowflake is hybrid architecture - mixture of shared-nothing and shared disk 
     (i.e Shared disk - data is stored on a shared-data (centralized location) storage layer 
    Shared Layer : All compute nodes access the same centralized storage (cloud object storage like S3

multi-cluster shared data architecture . Data and compute are independent components
- snowflake storage is unlimited
- As size of a virtual WH increases, amount of snowflake credit used increases propotionately 
- A large table in snowflake may contain millions of micro-partitions 

Snowflake is 3 tier archiecure
 -Data storage : stores data in a compresed, columnar format
-Query processing : Uses virtual WH for compute resources
- Cloud services: Manages infrastructure,metadata, security and optimization

--Storage Layer : 
 1. Snowflake supports AWS S3 storage  to store its data.
 2. Data loaded into snowflake is stored as files on cloud-based object stoage
 3. Files stored on cloud storage are immutable, which stored data can't updated once written, but it can only be appended.
 4. If any update is required, write as new file
 5. As users we can't see actual files and how data is stored
 6. In DB we always tend to perform CRUD operations - Files can't be updated  to overcome this snowflake uses concept called micro-partitioning to store  data
 7. Snowflake automatically organized into small partitions known as micro-partitions
 8.** Micro-partions are immutable, they can't changed once created, therefore inserts, updates, and delete require the creation of new micro- partition
 9. Each partion is 50MB to 500MB uncompressed data

--Query Processing 
 1. Virtual WH refer to compute clusters in snowflake - used to process queries and load data into snowflake
 2. Virtual WH are compute clusters, do not share any memory or CPU resources. Each VWH has dedicated memory & cpu that are not shared with any other VWH
