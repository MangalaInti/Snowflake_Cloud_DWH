1. Describes the behavior of a materialized view when columns are changed or dropped from the base table?
  - You must re-create the materialized view if you want to use it again.
  - The materialized view is suspended.
   When columns are changed or dropped from a base table with a materialized view on top, the change is not propagated to the 
   materialized view. The materialized view is suspended and can NOT be resumed. It must be re-created with the corrected definition 
  that reflects the changed/dropped columns.

2. A virtual warehouse is in a running state and is executing a complex query. The administrator increases the size of the virtual warehouse. What best describes the impact on the running query and any future queries?
 - Only future queries can take advantage of the increased size.
 - There is no impact on the running query.

3. multi-cluster virtual warehouse in auto-scale mode

   - When you start a multi-cluster virtual warehouse in auto-scaling mode
      1. Multi-cluster virtual warehouses support the same properties and actions as regular virtual warehouses. 
         They can be suspended, resumed, and modified to a different size.
      2. When Snowflake detects that queries are beginning to queue, additional warehouses are started.
      3. When the query demand decreases, warehouses are progressively shut down.
