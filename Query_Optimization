Snowflake doesnt require much of query tuning because of its unique architecture and micro-partition storage mechanism
However some performance inprovements can be considered

1. Scaling up the size of virtual WH to provide more processing power for complex queries
2. Scale out on multi-cluster VwH to provide more capacity for handling many concurrent users and concurrent queries
3. Using clustering keys to redistribute data in micro-partitions to achieve better partition purning
4. Built-in cache mechanisum improve performance behind scenes
5. Using MV to precompute results of complex, frequently executing queries
Caching helps to improve the query performance  and reduce latency.
Many SQL engines keeps the frequently accessed data in cache which improves respose time of a query

--Caching
-  It is automatic process to speed up the process
-  If query is executed twice, results are cached and can be re-used
-  Results are cached for 24 hrs or until underlaying data has changed.

Types of cache in snowflake 
 1. Metadata Cache
 2. Query result cache
 3. Virtual warehouse Local Disk cache



--What is a cluster key
-subset of rows to locate the data in micro-partition.
-Columns that are used most frequently in WHERE clause - often DATE columns 
- Join keys

--Micro-partition
Snowflake tables are divided into micro-partitions. Each partition contains 50MB to 500MB of uncompressed data
Rows in tables are organized in columnar fashion


For Micro-parition snowflake stores 
 - Range of values (min/max) values
 - Number of distinct values
 - NULL count

--How does micro-partition work
Cloud service will store metadata like min, max, distinct values and number of records for each partition


--Clustering
Clustering represents the way data is grouped together and stored within Snowflake's micro-partitions. It is a subset of snowflake table
where data is stored
Clustering key is hlpful in large tables to perform DML operations

Data clustering is process of partitioning the data  in such a way that it should be optimized.
In general data is sorted or ordered

--SHOW TABLES LIKE 'o_%';

Snowflake credits are used to organize the data into correct partitions as it is added to the table.
Micro-partitions are immutable objects.Once created it is not modified by snowflake rather re-created based on DML operations.
